  ```python
  import numpy as np
  arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
  print(arr.mean())  # Output: 2.5
  ```
  - **Solution**: Computes the mean of the array elements.

- **Pandas DataFrame Example from PDF**:
  ```python
  import pandas as pd
  data = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob'], 'Age': [25, 30]}
  df = pd.DataFrame(data)
  print(df.describe())
  ```
  - **Solution**: Provides statistical summary of the numeric columns.

### 9. Basic Text Processing

- **Summary**:
  Text processing involves cleaning and transforming textual data for NLP tasks. This includes tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and stopword removal.

- **Example from PDF**:
  ```python
  from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
  text = "Natural Language Processing is amazing!"
  print(word_tokenize(text))
  ```
  - **Solution**: Tokenizes the sentence into words.

### 10. Vector Space Model and Document Similarity

- **Summary**:
  The Vector Space Model (VSM) represents documents numerically for similarity computations. TF-IDF is a key technique used in VSM.

- **Example from PDF**:
  ```python
  from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
  docs = ["Machine learning is fun.", "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning."]
  vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
  vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(docs)
  print(vectors.toarray())
  ```
  - **Solution**: Converts documents into a TF-IDF matrix.

### 11. Distributional Hypothesis and Word Embeddings

- **Summary**:
  Word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe) map words into dense vector spaces based on their contextual usage.

- **Example from PDF**:
  ```python
  from gensim.models import Word2Vec
  sentences = [['deep', 'learning'], ['machine', 'learning']]
  model = Word2Vec(sentences, vector_size=5)
  print(model.wv['learning'])
  ```
  - **Solution**: Generates a vector representation for the word "learning".

### 12. N-grams and Language Models

- **Summary**:
  N-grams capture word sequences to build predictive language models.

- **Example from PDF**:
  ```python
  from nltk.util import ngrams
  text = "I love data science."
  bigrams = list(ngrams(text.split(), 2))
  print(bigrams)
  ```
  - **Solution**: Extracts bigrams from the given text.

### 13. Probability and Statistical NLP

- **Summary**:
  Probability and statistics aid in modeling language, such as using Bayesâ€™ Theorem for text classification.

- **Example from PDF**:
  ```python
  from collections import Counter
  def bayes_prob(prior, likelihood, evidence):
      return (likelihood * prior) / evidence
  print(bayes_prob(0.5, 0.6, 0.2))
  ```
  - **Solution**: Computes probability using Bayes' Theorem.

### 14. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)

- **Summary**:
  HMMs are used for sequence-based NLP tasks like POS tagging and speech recognition.

- **Example from PDF**:
  ```python
  import nltk
  from nltk.tag import hmm
  trainer = hmm.HiddenMarkovModelTrainer()
  print(trainer)
  ```
  - **Solution**: Initializes a Hidden Markov Model trainer for NLP tasks.

### 15. Neural Networks and Deep Learning for NLP

- **Summary**:
  Deep learning models enhance NLP tasks, using architectures like RNNs and Transformers.

- **Example from PDF**:
  ```python
  import torch
  import torch.nn as nn
  model = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(2, 2), nn.ReLU(), nn.Linear(2, 1))
  print(model)
  ```
  - **Solution**: Creates a simple neural network model.

### 16. Sentiment Analysis

- **Summary**:
  Sentiment analysis classifies text as positive, neutral, or negative.

- **Example from PDF**:
  ```python
  from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
  sia = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
  print(sia.polarity_scores("I love NLP!"))
  ```
  - **Solution**: Analyzes sentiment of the text.

### 17. Machine Translation

- **Summary**:
  Machine translation automates language translation using statistical and deep learning models.

- **Example from PDF**:
  ```python
  from transformers import MarianMTModel, MarianTokenizer
  model_name = "Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-fr"
  tokenizer = MarianTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
  model = MarianMTModel.from_pretrained(model_name)
  text = "Hello, how are you?"
  translated = model.generate(**tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt"))
  print(tokenizer.decode(translated[0]))
  ```
  - **Solution**: Translates English text to French.

### 18. Speech Recognition

- **Summary**:
  Converts spoken language into text using deep learning-based models.

- **Example from PDF**:
  ```python
  import speech_recognition as sr
  recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
  with sr.Microphone() as source:
      audio = recognizer.listen(source)
  print(recognizer.recognize_google(audio))
  ```
  - **Solution**: Converts speech to text.

### 19. Information Retrieval and Search Engines

- **Summary**:
  Search engines use ranking models like BM25 and PageRank to retrieve relevant documents.

- **Example from PDF**:
  ```python
  from whoosh.index import create_in
  from whoosh.fields import Schema, TEXT
  schema = Schema(title=TEXT(stored=True), content=TEXT)
  ```
  - **Solution**: Defines an indexing schema for document retrieval.

### 20. Ethics and Bias in NLP

- **Summary**:
  Ensuring fairness in NLP models requires addressing biases in training data and algorithms.

- **Example from PDF**:
  ```python
  from transformers import pipeline
  unmasker = pipeline("fill-mask", model="bert-base-uncased")
  print(unmasker("The doctor is a [MASK]."))
  ```
  - **Solution**: Identifies potential gender bias in language models.
